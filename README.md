# Fetch Take-home Assignment
Hello! Welcome to my small JSON-fetching and displaying app for Fetch Rewards' internship program. 
## Quickstart
In terminal, just input the following command: 
```
git clone https://github.com/stsingh/FetchTakeHome.git
```
Then, just open the directory using Android Studio and you're good to go! Boot the app up and click on the "Fetch" button and the ListView should populate.
